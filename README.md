# SkinSeoul Product Assortment & Sales Strategy 🚀
## 📌 Project Overview
SkinSeoul, a leading K-Beauty brand, wanted to optimize its product assortment, pricing, and sales strategy to boost revenue while staying competitive in the market. This project involved data analysis, competitor benchmarking, and strategic recommendations to improve sales performance.

Additionally, an interactive Power BI dashboard was designed to visualize key metrics such as sales trends, profitability, stock levels, and promotional campaign performance.

📊 Objective & Key Business Questions
1️⃣ Pricing Strategy Analysis
Are our prices competitive compared to the market?

How can we maximize profit while maintaining customer demand?

Should pricing be adjusted based on stock levels and product performance?

2️⃣ Promotional Campaign & Sales Strategy
Which products need a sales boost (slow-moving or high-potential items)?

What type of promotions (discounts, bundles, seasonal offers) would drive the most sales?

How can we leverage digital marketing (social media, influencers, and ads) to increase brand reach?
